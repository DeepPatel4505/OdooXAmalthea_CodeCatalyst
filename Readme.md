# Expense Management System

A comprehensive expense reimbursement platform that streamlines approval workflows, supports multi-level approvals, and provides flexible approval rules for organizations.

## Problem Statement

Companies often struggle with manual expense reimbursement processes that are time-consuming, error-prone, and lack transparency. This system addresses these challenges by providing:

- Threshold-based approval flows
- Multi-level approval management
- Flexible and conditional approval rules
- Automated expense tracking and transparency

## Core Features

### 1. Authentication & User Management

- **Auto-Setup**: On first login/signup, a new Company and Admin User are automatically created
- **Currency Configuration**: Company currency is automatically set based on the selected country
- **User Management**: 
  - Admin can create Employees and Managers
  - Assign and modify roles (Employee, Manager, Admin)
  - Define manager-employee relationships

### 2. Expense Submission (Employee Role)

Employees can:
- Submit expense claims with details:
  - Amount (supports multiple currencies)
  - Category
  - Description
  - Date
  - Receipt attachments
- View complete expense history
- Track approval status (Approved/Rejected/Pending)

### 3. Approval Workflow (Manager/Admin Role)

**Sequential Approval Process**:
- Expenses follow a defined approval sequence
- Each approver must act before moving to the next level
- Optional manager pre-approval if "IS MANAGER APPROVER" field is checked

**Example Workflow**:
```
Step 1 â†’ Manager
Step 2 â†’ Finance
Step 3 â†’ Director
```

**Manager Capabilities**:
- View pending approval requests
- Approve or reject expenses with comments
- All amounts displayed in company's default currency

### 4. Conditional Approval Rules

The system supports sophisticated approval logic:

- **Percentage Rule**: Expense approved if X% of approvers approve
  - Example: If 60% of approvers approve â†’ Auto-approved
  
- **Specific Approver Rule**: Designated approver can auto-approve
  - Example: If CFO approves â†’ Expense auto-approved
  
- **Hybrid Rules**: Combine multiple conditions
  - Example: 60% approval OR CFO approval
  
- **Combined Flows**: Mix sequential multi-level approvals with conditional rules

### 5. OCR Receipt Scanning

Advanced optical character recognition for receipt processing:
- Scan physical receipts using mobile or desktop camera
- Automatically extract:
  - Amount
  - Date
  - Description
  - Expense lines
  - Expense type
  - Vendor name (e.g., restaurant name)
- Pre-populate expense submission form
